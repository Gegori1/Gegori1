### Welcome

**I am a Data Analyst and Data Scientist from Mexico**

Hello! I'm passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems and drive innovation. My primary focus is researching and developing Support Vector Regression (SVR) models.

In addition to my work with SVR, I am keenly interested in a wide range of data-related projects. Whether it's data cleaning, visualization, or deploying machine learning models, I enjoy exploring the full spectrum of data science and its applications.
